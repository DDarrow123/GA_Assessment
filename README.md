# GA_Assessment

Goal: To show off my skills in building an About Me page for submission to General Assemb.ly's Fall 18 immersive program.

With HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I will use elements of what I've learned so far in the intro to Front-End Web Development course that I just concluded at GA over a 10-week period. 

Thanks! 
Devon
